    The purpose of this website is to research universities that I plan to apply for in the upcoming 2020 school year. I am most interested in majoring in Engineering with a slight possibility of going into Business. 
    Although there are plenty of opportunties within each field, currently I am most interested in Electrical, Software, and Computer Engineering. However, if I were to go into business I would look into
    accounting, finance, and even possibly human resources.

    <br> <br>

    Personally, I would like to attend a diverse university with around 5,000-10,000 enrolled students somewhere along the east coast. I am open to almost any university,
    but a few of my top picks are Stony Brook, Clemson, and Furman University. Each of these university offer great engineering and business programs depending on which major I decide upon. 
    Each of the sub-pages will also go into more depth about the information for each college. A few important factors that are considered
    are the majors offered, scholarships, admission requirements, and campus/housing options.

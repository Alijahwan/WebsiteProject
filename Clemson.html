        Moving past the rankings, Clemson offers plenty more than educational benefits. They offer a multitude of diversity programs including Cultural Exchange Community, Global Engagement, 
        International Festival, and Multicultural programs. Additionally, there are plenty of club opportunities along with recreational activities offered on campus. 
        This includes Intrumural Sports, Clemson Outdoor Recreation and Education (CORE), Center for Visual Arts, and a host of other clubs. Unfortunately, Clemson does not offer
        many academic scholarships, many come from athletics and sports such as football. However, Clemson does have a variety of housing opportunities, especially for first year students.
        They offer both residence halls and suites with the option of living in local apartments which are relatively close to campus. Additionally, there are a great deal of
        fraternities and Sororities for students to pick from, making housing at Clemson very enjoyable.
